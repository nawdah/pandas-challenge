## Heroes of Pymoli

I have worked on the **Heroes of Pymoli** option of the homework. Based of the code, I noticed a few important trends. Listed below are 3 of them. 

-Based on the **Purchasing Analysis** of the three genders specified, Males made up a higher percentage of _Purchase Count_. However, players who chose Other / Non-Disclosed had a higher _Average Purchase Price_, at $3.35, than Males or Females.

-The **Purchasing Analysis** grouped by age demographic showed that players aged 20-24 years old were the majority age group of all players. Their group held a percentage of 44.79% and spent a total of $1,114.06. 

-Of the **Most Popular Items**, _Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm_ was the most grossed product of the game, with a _Purchase Count_ of 12 and _Total Purchase Value_ of $50.76.
