## Heroes of Pymoli

I have worked on the **Heroes of Pymoli** option of the homework. Based of the code, I noticed a few important trends. Listed below are 3 of them. 

*Based on the **Purchasing Analysis** of the three genders specified, Males made up a higher percentage of _ _Purchase Count_ _. However, players who chose Other / Non-Disclosed had a higher _ _Average Purchase Price_ _, at $3.35, than Males or Females.

*The **Purchasing Analysis** grouped by age demographic showed that players aged 20-24 years old were the majority age group of all players. Their group held a percentage of 44.79% and spent a total of $1,114.06. 

*Of the **Most Popular Items**, _ _Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm_ _ was the most grossed product of the game, with a _ _Purchase Count_ _ of 12 and _ _Total Purchase Value_ _ of $50.76.
